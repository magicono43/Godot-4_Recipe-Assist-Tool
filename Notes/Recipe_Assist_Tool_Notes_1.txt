Maybe see if I can have a little popup show up when trying to enter
invalid characters into a specific text-entry field, just to give some
indication what is intended to go there, not a big deal though for that
it would be primarily polish at that point.

If I don't decide to work on that, then maybe see if I can get like a list
of "alternate names" for various ingredients in my data-base. So like
if you happen to call powdered sugar, confectioners sugar. Or
All Purpose Flour, White Flour, or just Flour or something, then the
auto-complete and data-base would account for that and still hopefully
give you the result you were looking for or something like that.
And maybe even something similar to how Interkarma did the location
searching on the world-map UI for Daggerfall Unity, where entering
in text gives you the "closest match" sort of thing, instead of having
to be exact from start to finish, will see.

Possibly even consider having a "sub-menu" sort of thing if searching
with more generic names like just "Flour" or "Sugar" and that sub-menu
would give options for items that are similar to that term and such
more work obviously, but could work fairly well potentially.
