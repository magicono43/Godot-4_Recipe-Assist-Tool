Maybe see if I can have a little popup show up when trying to enter
invalid characters into a specific text-entry field, just to give some
indication what is intended to go there, not a big deal though for that
it would be primarily polish at that point.

If I don't decide to work on that, then maybe see if I can get like a list
of "alternate names" for various ingredients in my data-base. So like
if you happen to call powdered sugar, confectioners sugar. Or
All Purpose Flour, White Flour, or just Flour or something, then the
auto-complete and data-base would account for that and still hopefully
give you the result you were looking for or something like that.
And maybe even something similar to how Interkarma did the location
searching on the world-map UI for Daggerfall Unity, where entering
in text gives you the "closest match" sort of thing, instead of having
to be exact from start to finish, will see.

Possibly even consider having a "sub-menu" sort of thing if searching
with more generic names like just "Flour" or "Sugar" and that sub-menu
would give options for items that are similar to that term and such
more work obviously, but could work fairly well potentially.

I'll have to think of what feature or thing to work on next in this tool. I have the stuff above this note, but I don't think those are really necessary to get this 
to function, so I think many of the things up there would be mostly in the later "polish" category, if I ever get to that phase. So I need to think of other more 
necessary features to work on next. Possibly some optional multiplier for the entire current list of ingredients, such as 2x, 0.5x, etc.

The next feature (that will be more difficult than the past few weeks.) would be a way to add custom ingredients to the "database." So if you have osme item with particular 
values that isn't on the fairly short list of existing "default" ingredients, you can make entirely custom ones and those would be taken into account just like all of the 
other existing one, but more than likely stored in a seperate .json file. 

Have some idea how I might do this, but will have to do alot of research and testing to get the basic input and file creation stuff working, but will see how it goes, etc.
